#### 乐币概述

乐币（Le）是由人民币作为背书而发行的一种代币。乐币和绿宝石不同的地方在于，它是由资产做担保的代币，而其底层担保货币是人民币。总的来说作为由人民币背书的代币，它更加稳定，也可以被视作MC熟人市场上的避险港湾，近一年来乐币的价值保持在50人民币毫无浮动。LE也提供了连接MC熟人市场和传统货币市场的桥梁。
其内置发行规则特别的简单，和港元类似。即每发行一单元的LE就要存入50人民币背书，因此理论上市面上的乐币发行数量应该和其背书的人民币相等。用户可以通过电汇人民币至乐乐提供的账户获得LE币。

#### 记账模型

Le基于熟人记账模型中的`熟人+GZ加密+Q群混合交易模型`进行交易，其集聚`熟人性`、`隐藏性`、`加密性`三大特点于一身。LE由格兰蒂部分水友们共同发行，其中，Gzzchh的《基于gz加密的熟人Q群混合加密数字货币交易模型》论文对LE币起到了巨大贡献，是LE币 建立的基础。

#### 分配制度

初始分配12%总量的Le于乐乐、12%总量的Le发给贺兰、12%总量的Le发给uuz、12%总量的Le发给gzz、12%总量的Le发给V，剩下的进入市场流通。Le总发行量为：1,145,141,919,810.00000000LE。

#### 优势

Le通过`熟人+GZ加密+Q群混合交易模型`很好的解决了熟人记账困难、熟人黑吃黑、绿宝石记账繁琐、挖矿导致显卡/硬盘价格浮动、矿工挖矿耗费过多电力、矿机产生的废弃热量导致全球变暖加速等棘手问题。

**Le币坚守`三绝对`原则：1. 绝对熟人、2. 绝对稳定、3. 绝对乐乐。**

#### 我们相较于绿宝石的优势

+ 价格稳定：乐币和绿宝石不同的地方在于，它是由资产做担保的代币，而其底层担保货币是人民币。总的来说作为由人民币背书的代币，它更加稳定，也可以被视作MC熟人市场上的避险港湾，近一年来乐币的价值保持在50人民币毫无浮动。拒绝市场操控乐币价格。
+ 交易公开透明：乐币的所有交易，都可以在LeLeCoin的通证详情页面查看，上链交易，无法篡改。
+ 交易便捷 ：熟人圈内所熟知的 50哥（民间俗称Vlele）接单，因其接简单的技术单价格常为 50 RMB而得名，使用人民币转账繁琐复杂。使用Le交易，仅需在链上向其转账1LeCoin即可。

##### 我们与其他加密数字货币的不同

第一，区块链1.0时代，以BTC为代表，发展时间（2008年—2017年），发展的核心价值（分布式记账和储存），2017年第一次牛市，BTC比特币涨到2万美金。

此时，很少人有这个认知，都认为是BTC是一个庞大骗局。只有少部分信仰布道者实现财富自由身份

第二，区块链2.0时代，以ETH以太坊为代表，发展时间（2017年—2020年6月）发展的核心价值（智能合约链）ETH以太坊最高涨幅到达 4000美金。

而乐币并不会出现此类问题。其内置发行规则特别的简单，和港元类似。即每发行一单元的LE就要存入50人民币背书，因此理论上市面上的乐币发行数量应该和其背书的人民币相等。用户可以通过电汇人民币至乐乐提供的账户获得LE币。其体现了乐币三绝对原则的第二条：绝对稳定。

#### Le Coin Overview

Le Coin (Le) is a token issued with RMB as backing. The difference between Le and Emerald is that it is a token backed by assets, and its underlying backing currency is RMB. In general, as a token backed by RMB, it is more stable and can be seen as a safe haven in the MC acquaintance market, with the value of LE coin remaining at 50 RMB for almost a year without fluctuation.
Its built-in issuance rules are particularly simple, similar to the Hong Kong dollar. That is, for every unit of LE issued, 50 RMB backing has to be deposited, so theoretically the number of LE coins issued on the market should be equal to the amount of RMB backing it. Users can obtain LE coins by wire transferring RMB to the account provided by LELO.

#### Bookkeeping Model

LE is based on the `acquaintance+GZ encryption+Q group hybrid transaction model` in the acquaintance bookkeeping model, which combines `acquaintance`, `hidden` and `encryption` characteristics. LE is issued by some of the water friends of Grandy, among which, Gzzchh's `gz encryption-based acquaintance Q group hybrid crypto digital currency transaction model` paper plays a great contribution to LE coin, which is the The foundation of LE coin was established.

#### Allocation System

Initially, 12% of the total amount of Le is allocated to Lele, 12% of the total amount of Le is sent to Horan, 12% of the total amount of Le is sent to uuz, 12% of the total amount of Le is sent to gzz, 12% of the total amount of Le is sent to V, and the rest goes into market circulation. the total amount of Le issued is: 1,145,141,919,810.00000000LE.

#### Advantage

Le is a good solution to the thorny problems of difficult bookkeeping for acquaintances, black out for acquaintances, tedious bookkeeping for emeralds, floating video card/hard disk prices due to mining, excessive power consumption by miners for mining, and accelerated global warming due to waste heat generated by miners through the `acquaintance+GZ encryption+Q group hybrid transaction model`.

**Le coin adheres to the `three absolute` principle: 1. absolute acquaintance, 2. absolute stability, and 3. absolute joy. **

#### Our Advantages Compared to Emerald

+ Price Stability: The difference between LeCoin and Emerald is that it is a token secured by assets, and its underlying secured currency is RMB. Overall as a token backed by RMB, it is more stable and can also be seen as a safe-haven in the MC acquaintance market. The value of LeCoin has remained at 50 RMB without fluctuation for almost a year. It refuses to be manipulated by the market.
+ Open and transparent transactions: All transactions of LeCoin can be viewed on LeLeCoin's pass details page, and transactions on the chain cannot be tampered with.
+ Convenient transaction: The familiar 50 Brother (popularly known as Vlele) takes orders, which is named because the price of a simple technical order is often 50 RMB, and it is tedious and complicated to transfer money using RMB. To trade with Le, you only need to transfer 1 LeCoin to him on the chain.

##### How we differ from other crypto digital currencies

First, blockchain 1.0 era, represented by BTC, development time (2008-2017), the core value of development (distributed bookkeeping and storage), the first bull market in 2017, BTC bitcoin rose to $20,000.

At this point, very few people had this knowledge and all thought it was BTC was a massive scam. Only a small number of faith evangelists achieve wealth freedom status

Second, blockchain 2.0 era, represented by ETH Ether, the development time (2017 - June 2020) development of the core value (smart contract chain) ETH Ether highest rise reached $ 4000.

LeCoin, on the other hand, does not suffer from such problems. Its built-in issuance rules are particularly simple, similar to the Hong Kong dollar. That is, for every unit of LE issued, 50 RMB backing should be deposited, so the theoretical number of LE coins issued on the market should be equal to the amount of RMB backing it. Users can obtain LE coins by wire transferring RMB to the account provided by LELO. It embodies the second of the three absolute principles of LELECoin: absolute stability.
