## LECoin-Whitepaper-EN

Le Coin (LE) is a token issued with RMB as backing. The difference between LE coin and Emerald is that it is a token backed by assets, and its underlying backing currency is RMB. In general, as a token backed by RMB, it is more stable and can be seen as a safe haven in the MC acquaintance market, with the value of LE coin remaining at 50 RMB for almost a year without fluctuation.
Its built-in issuance rules are particularly simple, similar to the Hong Kong dollar. That is, for every unit of LE issued, 50 RMB backing has to be deposited, so theoretically the number of LE coins issued on the market should be equal to the amount of RMB backing it. Users can obtain LE coins by wire transferring RMB to the account provided by LE coin
